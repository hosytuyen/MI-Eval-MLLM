## Overview
Official Code for [Revisiting Model Inversion Evaluation: From Misleading Standards to Reliable Privacy Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03519)

We discovered that most Model Inversion (MI) attack evaluations are misleading. The standard framework often counts Type-I adversarial examples—images that don’t actually resemble private data—as “successful” reconstructions. This means many reported privacy risks are overestimated. To fix this, we introduce a new MLLM-based evaluation framework using Multimodal LLMs for more reliable, task-agnostic assessment. Re-evaluating 26 MI attack setups, we find inflated success rates across the board—real privacy leakage is much lower than claimed. Our work redefines how MI attacks should be evaluated and sets a new benchmark for robust privacy research.

## Environment Setup

### Using Conda
```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n mi-eval python=3.8
conda activate mi-eval

# Install required packages
pip install torch torchvision
pip install pillow
pip install google-generativeai
pip install jupyter notebook
pip install pathlib
```

## Data Preparation
1. For evaluating a new MI attack, prepare your reconstructed images in the following structure:
   ```
   AttackSamples/
   └── your_private_dataset/
       └── your_public_attack/
           └── your_target_model/
               └── all-images/
                   ├── 0/    # Class 0 reconstructed images
                   ├── 1/    # Class 1 reconstructed images
                   └── 2/    # Class 2 reconstructed images
   ```
2. Each subfolder (0, 1, 2) should contain the reconstructed .png/.jpg/.jpeg images for that class
3. We provide examples of reconstructed images from 26 different MI setups in the `AttackSamples` directory

## MLLM-based MI Evaluation Framework

1. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. Set up your environment as described above
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in `gemini_evaluation.ipynb` for the evaluation


## (Optional) Additional Analysis to reproduce results in Tab. 3 in the main paper.
We provide implementation to investigate the limitations of common standard MI evaluation frameworks in `analysis.ipynb`.
